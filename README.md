# Mushroom Classifier
Poisoned mushrooms is a program that uses a Naive Bayes classifier to determine the edibility of a mushroom based on its description. The program is trained on a dataset of mushroom descriptions, which includes information about the mushroom's characteristics such as its shape, color, and habitat. The Naive Bayes classifier uses this information to calculate the probability that a mushroom is edible. This project aims to provide a tool for mushroom hunters, who want to know quickly whether the mushroom they found is edible or not, by just providing a description of it. It's a simple and efficient way to classify mushroom based on the features of the mushroom and its features.
